## Reflection

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

- The main git concept i was struggling with prior to GPS 1.1 was pulling. Although I am pretty well acquainted with pushing and pulling via origin (locally), I got very confused on a past assignment when I was instructed to do "pull request" via GitHub. Although I did not have a pair, I was able to figure out by playing with the request on GitHub. What helped most with this was downloading the actual GitHub app for mac. Its pretty intuitive and even shows branch maps.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

-Concepts clairified during GPS were mainly Git. Although I had no pair, I continued to re-read notes, and stumbled upon I pretty neat book: "Learn Git In A Month of Lunches" by Rick Umali. Not finished with it but it reinforces alot of what we learned from the week on Git.I have been pretty good with the git and github workflow. Practice makes perfect and i feel the more ive been doing it the better ive been getting.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

-Unfortunately I do not have an answer to this question because I missed my GPS. This is the make-up.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

-There isnt anything about git that currently confuses me. Im very well acquainted with what we have learned so far. Git and GitHub are pretty user friendly. If anything, I could probably learn the commands and the capabilities / shortcuts they possess. To help with this, ive purchased the Codecademy pro version and will be shortly on the "learn Git" section which should help reinforce some of the skills learned. The book i picked up ("Learn Git In A Month of Lunches" by Rick Umali) should also help with this. Also, more peer-pairings should definitely help me with picking up more tips and tricks on Git & GitHub.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

- Again, I will not be able to answer this as there was no GPS experience without a GPS (no ones fault but mine).


## Release 3

-This is a release that i was unable to complete do to not having a pair. This release would have demonstrated the ability to share work with a team by utilizing the git push feature to push work into the github repository from the local team members repository. A team member could then git pull from their local repository and have their repo updated with (current verison of repo) all latest work pushed to github repo.

## Release 5

- This is another release i was unable to do. The importance of this release was to demonstrate the possibility of a merge conflict when working in teams. Although the merge conflicts ive run into have been minor, its pretty apparent that teams can be fairly large with each individual working on with a vast amount of code. When merging in these situations there can be some pretty complex merge issues. Terminal is good at informing about merge issues, which are then opened in text editors and the user can decide which code should be kept and then solve the merge issues.

## Release 6

- the final release i was unable to do. Good Git workflow involves the process of creating a repo, and verifying branch(s). Once verified, create and checkout into a feature branch. The feature branch is where youll edit files or folders, stage for committ, and then commit (save any edits). Youll then merge and solve any conflicts. checkout into the master branch and push up to Github. Github is where team members will pull from to get the latest version of code along with the edits you have made. So that they will understand your code, it is vital that you comment your code and commit with an generally understandable message.
