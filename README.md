# phase-0-gps-1

This is my first GPS. I will be doing this on my own since there are no Make-Up GPS's available

## Terminal Commands used so far:

### mkdir

- Ive used this to make folders.

### cd

- I use this to change directories. this has alot of "sub" commands. Im sure there is a better term than sub but i can give a better example of the different ways i use "cd":

  * cd .. - the "dot dot" tells the terminal to jump up one directory


### ls

- Used to list the items in the current working directory

  * ls -la - lists the items hidden like "git"

### rm

- used to remove files or directories. only works on empty directories.

  * rm -rf - can use this extension to remove directories with files inside of them

### mv

- I use this to copy files from one directory to another

### clear

- i use this to clear the terminal of work

### pwd

- This command prints the working directory. I rarely use this because the code right before the cursor tells me which directory im currently working in.
